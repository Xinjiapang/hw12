Sound sensor & Arduino

In this project, I will make an Arduino project with lights. The lights will be controlled by sound.



Summary

For this project, I decided to build a program that people can track how loud a sound is. The materials I used are Arduino, several LED Lights, a sound sensor, and wires. When there is a sound comes out, like speaking or playing music, the LED light will light up. When the sound getting louder, more light will turn on. 

This program could use at a library or an environment that require less sound. It will help people to know that their voices are over an average requirement.
